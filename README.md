 **Project Title:** Basic Spam Detection Using Machine Learning  

**Problem Statement:**  
In the digital age, spam messages—unwanted emails, text messages, or social media messages—pose risks such as scams, phishing attacks, and wasted time. Manually filtering spam is inefficient and error-prone. This project addresses the need for **automated identification of spam messages**, improving communication security and user productivity.  

**Objective:**  
- Automatically classify messages as spam or not spam  
- Improve user safety and reduce exposure to unwanted or harmful content  
- Serve as a foundation for more advanced spam detection systems  

**Tools & Technologies:**  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Data Handling:** Pandas, NumPy  
- **Text Preprocessing:** NLTK / SpaCy (tokenization, stopword removal)  
- **Feature Extraction:** TF-IDF Vectorizer or Count Vectorizer  
- **Machine Learning Models:**  Decision Tree  
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score  
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn  

**Key Outcomes:**  
- Built a model capable of predicting spam messages with high accuracy (~96% on common datasets)  
- Gained hands-on experience with the end-to-end ML workflow: preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation  

**Next Steps:**  
- Deploy the model for real-time spam detection using Streamlit or Flask  
- Explore deep learning models like LSTM or BERT for advanced spam detection
